# Todo-App TDD Workshop

This is a minimal Java **Todo List** service used for a 1‑hour unit‑testing & TDD practice.

## Quick Start (GitHub Codespaces)

```bash
mvn test        # run all tests
```

Feel free to add more tests first (Red), implement just enough code to make them pass (Green), and then refactor with confidence (Refactor).
